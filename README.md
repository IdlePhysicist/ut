# UT

*IdlePhysicist, 2019*

This is a very basic (and limited) piece of software. It was written in about 15 minutes for one purpose, I decided to commit it here because it might be useful in the future and will save me 15 minutes down the road. 

##Â Usage

```shell
$ ut 2019-08-01
```

The `-n` flag fudges the calculation by taking the time to be noon that day and not midnight, this is because I found that I was getting the pervious date when I re-parsed the timestamp.
